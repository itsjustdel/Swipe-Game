# Prototype for an online fighting/area control game

A game which is completely procedurally generated, with the ability to 'draw' your own swords swings with the thumbstick of a game pad. Features client prediction to smooth out network issues and an authorative server to reduce glitches and cheating. Network connection code handled by [PUN2](https://www.photonengine.com/pun), events and movement, self written.

Currently in closed testing.
